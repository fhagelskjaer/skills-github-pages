This is the first blog post. In this blog I will give an overview of the bin picking project. 

In this blog I will collect the different materials (papers, repositories) created during the bin picking project.

The blog will also contain observations that I have made during the project. Both about pose estimation, bin picking, software architecture and general software tools.

I hope the blog will be educational.
